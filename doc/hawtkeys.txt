**hawtkeys.nvim** is a nvim plugin for finding and suggesting memorable and
easy-to-press keys for your nvim shortcuts. It takes into consideration
keyboard layout, easy-to-press combinations and memorable phrases, and excludes
already mapped combinations to provide you with suggested keys for your
commands


INSTALLATION                             *hawtkeys-hawtkeys.nvim-installation*

Installation instructions to follow, but as usual with package managers

>lua
    return {
        "tris203/hawtkeys.nvim",
        config = true,
    }
<


USAGE                                           *hawtkeys-hawtkeys.nvim-usage*


SEARCHING NEW KEYMAPS ~

There are two interfaces to hawtkeys, the first allows you to Search For
Keymaps:

>
    :Hawtkeys
<

This will allow you to search key binds as below:


SHOW ALL EXISTING KEYMAPS ~

>
    :HawtkeysAll
<

This will launch a window showing all existing keymaps collected from Neovim
bindings and analysis of your config file.


SHOWING DUPLICATE KEYMAPS ~

>
    HawtkeysDupes
<

It will show potential duplicate keymaps, where you have accidentally set the
same key for two different things. This can be useful for tracking down issues
with plugins not functioning correctly


CONFIG                                         *hawtkeys-hawtkeys.nvim-config*

>lua
    return {
        leader = " ", -- the key you want to use as the leader, default is space
        homerow = 2, -- the row you want to use as the homerow, default is 2
        powerFingers = { 2, 3, 6, 7 }, -- the fingers you want to use as the powerfingers, default is {2,3,6,7}
        keyboardLayout = "qwerty", -- the keyboard layout you use, default is qwerty
        customMaps = {
            --- EG local map = vim.api
            --- map.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>1', '<cmd>echo 1')
            {
                ["map.nvim_set_keymap"] = { --name of the expression
                    modeIndex = "1", -- the position of the mode setting
                    lhsIndex = "2", -- the position of the lhs setting
                    rhsIndex = "3", -- the position of the rhs setting
                    optsIndex = "4", -- the position of the index table
                    method = "dot_index_expression", -- if the function name contains a dot
                },
            },
            --- EG local map2 = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap
            ["map2"] = { --name of the function
                modeIndex = 1, --if you use a custom function with a fixed value, eg normRemap, then this can be a fixed mode eg 'n'
                lhsIndex = 2,
                rhsIndex = 3,
                optsIndex = 4,
                method = "function_call",
            },
            -- If you use whichkey.register with an alias eg wk.register
            ["wk.register"] = {
                method = "which_key",
            },
            -- If you use lazy.nvim's keys property to configure keymaps in your plugins
            ["lazy"] = {
                method = "lazy",
            },
        },
        highlights = { -- these are the highlight used in search mode
            HawtkeysMatchGreat = { fg = "green", bold = true },
            HawtkeysMatchGood = { fg = "green"},
            HawtkeysMatchOk = { fg = "yellow" },
            HawtkeysMatchBad = { fg = "red" },
        },
    }
<

The default config will get all keymaps using the `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap` and
`vim.keymap.set`.
