# ‚å®Ô∏èüî• hawtkeys.nvim

**hawtkeys.nvim** is a nvim plugin for finding and suggesting memorable and easy-to-press keys for your nvim shortcuts.
It takes into consideration keyboard layout, easy-to-press combinations and memorable phrases, and excludes already mapped combinations to provide you with suggested keys for your commands

## üì¶ Installation

Installation instructions to follow, but as usual with package managers

```lua

return {
    "tris203/hawtkeys.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    },
    config = {
        -- an empty table will work for default config
        --- if you use functions, or whichkey, or lazy to map keys
        --- then please see the API below for options
    },
}
```

## ‚ùîUsage

### Searching New Keymaps

There are three interfaces to hawtkeys, the first allows you to Search For Keymaps:

```
:Hawtkeys
```

This will allow you to search key binds as below:

![demo](https://github.com/tris203/hawtkeys.nvim/assets/18444302/5ede9881-34d5-4ef4-a15d-80f2c94b314d)

### Show All Existing Keymaps

```
:HawtkeysAll
```

This will launch a window showing all existing keymaps collected from Neovim bindings and analysis of your config file.

### Showing Duplicate Keymaps

```
HawtkeysDupes
```

It will show potential duplicate keymaps, where you have accidentally set the same key for two different things. This can be useful for tracking down issues with plugins not functioning correctly

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

```lua
return {
    leader = " ", -- the key you want to use as the leader, default is space
    homerow = 2, -- the row you want to use as the homerow, default is 2
    powerFingers = { 2, 3, 6, 7 }, -- the fingers you want to use as the powerfingers, default is {2,3,6,7}
    keyboardLayout = "qwerty", -- the keyboard layout you use, default is qwerty
    customMaps = {
        --- EG local map = vim.api
        --- map.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>1', '<cmd>echo 1')
        {
            ["map.nvim_set_keymap"] = { --name of the expression
                modeIndex = "1", -- the position of the mode setting
                lhsIndex = "2", -- the position of the lhs setting
                rhsIndex = "3", -- the position of the rhs setting
                optsIndex = "4", -- the position of the index table
                method = "dot_index_expression", -- if the function name contains a dot
            },
        },
        --- EG local map2 = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap
        ["map2"] = { --name of the function
            modeIndex = 1, --if you use a custom function with a fixed value, eg normRemap, then this can be a fixed mode eg 'n'
            lhsIndex = 2,
            rhsIndex = 3,
            optsIndex = 4,
            method = "function_call",
        },
        -- If you use whichkey.register with an alias eg wk.register
        ["wk.register"] = {
            method = "which_key",
        },
        -- If you use lazy.nvim's keys property to configure keymaps in your plugins
        ["lazy"] = {
            method = "lazy",
        },
    },
    highlights = { -- these are the highlight used in search mode
        HawtkeysMatchGreat = { fg = "green", bold = true },
        HawtkeysMatchGood = { fg = "green"},
        HawtkeysMatchOk = { fg = "yellow" },
        HawtkeysMatchBad = { fg = "red" },
    },
}
```

The default config will get all keymaps using the `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap` and `vim.keymap.set`.
